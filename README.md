The project is seperated in two parts. So, there are two repositories (NewsAPI and NewsAPP).
The first part is about building the library NewsAPI and the second one is about building application named NewsAPP which is about getting top-headlines news or everything news according to specific criterias.

The application «NewsAPP» can be found in this repository. 

User can see that there is a class named Application which includes a menu with specific choices about getting news and user has just to select one of the choices by typing the suitable number. When user types a specific choice from the menu, the results are displayed in a console inside the programm. 

Also, it is worth noting that the menu in application is separated to three parts. The first one is about getting top-headlines news either for user’s country by detecting automatically user’s country via IP Address or for another country or a specific category. The second one is about getting everything news according to specific criterias. The third one is about exiting the program when user finishes their tests. 

Last but not least, it has to be referred that when user types a choice of the menu, there are full and clear instructions to help them decide what parameters should type about the news they want to search for.

P.S. Ιn order to run this project, user has to write firstly their apiKey and ipv6 following the instructions in README of repository «NewsAPΙ».
